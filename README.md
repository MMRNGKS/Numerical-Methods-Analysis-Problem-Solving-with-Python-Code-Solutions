➡ A steel cylinder at 80°F of length 12" is placed in a commercially available liquid nitrogen bath (−315°F). If the thermal expansion coefficient of steel behaves as a second order polynomial function of temperature and the polynomial is found by regressing the data below, the reduction in the length of the cylinder in inches is ?
